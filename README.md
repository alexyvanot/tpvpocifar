# TPVPOCIFAR - Computer Vision Pipeline with CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates a complete computer vision pipeline using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It covers:

- Data loading and exploration
- Dataset preprocessing
- Model building using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of performance
- Model saving for inference
- Live prediction via Flask API and Streamlit interface

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the model
```bash
python training_notebook.py
```

### 3. Start the Flask API
```bash
python flask_api.py
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit Interface
In another terminal:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_interface.py
```

## üß™ How it Works

- The model is trained on 10 categories of 32x32 RGB images.
- A CNN with 2 convolution layers + dense layers performs classification.
- A user can upload their own image (must be 32x32x3) to get a prediction.
- The Streamlit app sends the image to the Flask API which returns the predicted class.
